# Chat Client in Qt

This is a practical project in UESTC, it allows user who has signed in on _Chat Client Server_ to login and chat with others on the same server.  
This application is based on TCP connection and Qt5.

### P.S.

The server of this project is developed by my roommate so the server code is nowhere in this repository.
